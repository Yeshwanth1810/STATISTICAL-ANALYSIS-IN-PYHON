# STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS-IN-PYHON :
# 1. Introduction to Statistical Analysis:
Statistical analysis is crucial in data science and machine learning for deriving insights and making predictions.
# Objective:
Understand and apply statistical methods to datasets using Python.
# 2. Tools and Libraries: 
# Python Libraries: Utilize essential libraries for statistical analysis:
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Numerical operations.
scipy: Scientific and technical computing.
# 3. Datasets:
Built-in Datasets: Use the Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library.
External Datasets: Explore datasets from:
Kaggle
UCI Machine Learning Repository
# 4. Basic Statistical Concepts:
Population vs. Sample: Understand the difference between a complete population and a sample subset.
Sampling: Importance and benefits of sampling for cost and time efficiency.
# 5. Descriptive Statistics:
Central Tendency:
Mean: Average value.
Median: Middle value in ordered data.
Mode: Most frequently occurring value.
Variability:
Standard Deviation: Measure of data spread.
Variance: Average of squared differences from the mean.
Range: Difference between maximum and minimum values.
Additional Measures:
Percentiles and Quartiles: Data distribution insights.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Spread of the middle 50% of values.
Skewness: Data asymmetry.
Kurtosis: Tailedness of the distribution.
# 6. Inferential Statistics:
Hypothesis Testing: Test hypotheses about population parameters based on sample data.
Confidence Intervals: Estimate the range likely containing the population parameter.
Regression Analysis: Model relationships between variables.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compare means across multiple groups.
Chi-Square Test: Test independence between categorical variables.
# 7. Python Implementation:

Setup: Install necessary libraries:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn statsmodels
Descriptive Statistics Examples: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and additional measures.
Inferential Statistics Examples: Perform hypothesis testing, compute confidence intervals, and conduct regression analysis.
